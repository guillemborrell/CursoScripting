                 is also suitable as an extension language for highly

                 systems, amongst which several flavors of UNIX, Amoeba,
                 the Apple Macintosh O.S., and MS-DOS. This tutorial
                 introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts
                 and features of the Python language and system. It
                 helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on
                 experience, but as the examples are self-contained, the
                 tutorial can be read off-line as well. For a
                 description of standard objects and modules, see the
                 Python Library Reference manual. The Python Reference
                 Manual gives a more formal definition of the
                 language.",
